# QuynhDao Cong

I have had the great pleasure of working with QuynhDao (QD) for 10+ years.  During this time, it's been a combination of peer, managerial and mentoring.  Her in-depth knowledge of the SCM (Software Configuration / Change Management Process) has grown since CVS and she's forgotten more than most will have evern encountered in the subject matter space.  We aren't simply talking minor projects, but the soup-to-nuts full-blown integration and migration, including support of top notch engineers and their problems

At a high level, these are the areas where she has had much practical experience.  Solutions development, implementation details, and execution.  

* Version Control : ClearCase, UCM, Git (GitWeb, Gitolite) and most recently GitHub Enterprise (Firewall since 2011 ... 2024 being the most recent cloud deployment)
* Package management : In-house tool (Cronus) migrated to 3rd party (Nexus) and adminstrative support (JFrog Artifactory)
* Enterprise solutions : most recently Google Cloud
* Documentation and Issue Tracking : Confluence and Jira
* SOX, Infrasturcture Security and reliability : The typical account management, license cost recovery, email and pager alerts for notifications, scripts/webhooks (aka triggers), restore-from-backup, region-exit, major and minor upgrades, etc.
* Security and integrations : sorry, not too many details here I can cover :)

Of course, accountability and the need to remain flexible.

Ultimately, when there was a system down, and management needed someone to step in and stem the tide of escalations when things were broken at 4A, work with the vendor to get things back online, and help document what we did, and could do better - there was no better person to have in your corner.
